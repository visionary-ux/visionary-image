## Features

- **Easy Blurhash:** Get started with Blurhash in 60 seconds.
- **Layout stability**: Eliminates Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) with true-to-size, responsive placeholders.
- **Automatic lazy loading**: Off-screen images are deferred, reducing initial pageload size and optimizing Interaction to Next Paint (INP).
- **Lighning-fast previews**: Renders placeholders early (by initial DOM layout) using URL-embedded Blurhash data, powered by [`visionary-url`](https://github.com/visionary-ux/visionary-url).
- **Framework tested**: Compatible with Remix, Next.js, and Vite and supports both client and server-side rendering (SSR, SSG).
- **Additional features**: Prevent image dragging; prevent user selecting image
- **Developer friendly**: Written in Typescript and [unit tested](./src/components/Image/__test__/).
  - Check out the [interactive Storybook sandbox](https://visionary-ux.github.io/visionary-image/)
- **Search performance**: Enhance search ranking potential by improving Core Web Vitals scores.

## Installation

Install via npm, yarn, or pnpm.

```bash
npm install --save visionary-image
```

## Usage

Begin by creating a Visionary image URL. This is then passed to the `src` prop of the Image component.

### Creating a Visionary Image URL

There are several ways to create a Visionary URL.

1. Use the [Visionary URL Maker](https://visionary.cloud/url-maker) for public image URLs
2. Use the [Drag & Drop Blurhash Generator](https://visionary.cloud/image-to-blurhash) for local image files
3. Use [visionary-url](https://github.com/visionary-ux/visionary-url) to programmatically generate a URL

### Render Image

```tsx
import { Image } from "visionary-image";

const ImageDetails = () => <Image alt="..." src="<Visionary URL>" />;
```

## Relevant Questions

### Do image placeholders render server-side?

Yes, Visionary Image supports server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), as well as client-side rendering. In server-rendered scenarios, the first layer (background color) renders immediately, followed by the Blurhash and image layers once the page loads in the client's browser.

### How long does the Blurhash canvas take to load?

Canvas operations are highly efficient in modern browsers. Rendering the 24x24 pixel Blurhash placeholder typically takes around 1ms.

### What is Blurhash and where can I learn more?

Blurhash uses Discrete Cosine Transforms to represent a color-accurate image placeholder as a compact string (in 20-30 characters). Check out the official [Blurhash docs](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash) for more info.
